- consists of cards 6-Ace (2-5 are removed)
- 2-6 players
- shuffled
- 6 cards are given to each player
- bottom card flipped and becomes trump suit
	- trump suit is highest rank
- cards placed on tump card on a right angle so its still visible
- cards are still in play and are drawn last
- if a successful defend occurs, the card is discarded

- player with highest trump card attacks first
- player to their left is the defender
	- proceeds clockwise
- if attack is successful, defender loses turn and attack is passed to next player
	- if attack fails, defender becomes next attacker


- defender attempts defence with a higher-ranking card
	- 8-spaces (attack) is lower than 10-spades (defence)
- they can also play card from trump suit


- end of turn the player must draw a new card and must have 6 cards in hand
	- unless deck is drained
- defenders final card must beat the last attack carrd, otherwise they pick up all the cards
	played through the round of attacks


- last person with cards is the loser (the fool or durak).
- sometimes first player to empty their hand is declared the winner
	- typically there are no winners, just losers
